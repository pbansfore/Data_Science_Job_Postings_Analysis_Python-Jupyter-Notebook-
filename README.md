# Project Overview

This project provides a data-driven analysis of the Data Science job market, aiming to identify high-demand skills and top-paying opportunities. Using Python, I analyzed job listings to uncover trends in salaries, locations, and required skills. The goal is to offer valuable insights for aspiring and current data analysts looking to make informed career decisions.

# Objective

1. What are the skills most in demand for the top 3 most popular data roles?
2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?
3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?
4. What are the optimal skills for data analysts to learn? (High Demand AND High Paying) 

# Tools

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **Python:** For analyzing the data and find critical insights.I also used the following Python libraries:
    - **Pandas Library:** To analyze the data. 
    - **Matplotlib Library:** To visualize the data.
    - **Seaborn Library:** To create more advanced visuals. 
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** To run my Python scripts which let me easily include my notes and analysis.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for executing my Python scripts.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my Python code and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# Data Preparation and Cleanup

This section outlines the steps taken to prepare the data for analysis, ensuring accuracy and usability.

## Import & Clean Up Data

```python
# Importing Libraries
import ast
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
from datasets import load_dataset
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  

# Loading Data
dataset = load_dataset('lukebarousse/data_jobs')
df = dataset['train'].to_pandas()

# Data Cleanup
df['job_posted_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['job_posted_date'])
df['job_skills'] = df['job_skills'].apply(lambda x: ast.literal_eval(x) if pd.notna(x) else x)
```

## Filter US Jobs

To focus my analysis on the U.S. job market, I apply filters to the dataset, narrowing down to roles based in the United States.

```python
df_US = df[df['job_country'] == 'United States']

```

# The Analysis

Each Jupyter notebook for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data job market. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question:

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles?

To find the most demanded skills for the top 3 most popular data roles. I filtered out those positions by which ones were the most popular, and got the top 5 skills for these top 3 roles. This query highlights the most popular job titles and their top skills, showing which skills I should pay attention to depending on the role I'm targeting.

### Visualize Data

```python
fig,ax=plt.subplots(len(Top_3_titles),1,figsize=(12,8))
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
for i,titles in enumerate(Top_3_titles):
    df_plot=df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short']==titles].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, x='skills_percent', y='job_skills', ax=ax[i], hue='skill_count', palette='dark:b_r')
    ax[i].set_title(titles)
    ax[i].set_ylabel(" ")
    ax[i].set_xlabel(" ")
    ax[i].legend().set_visible(False)
    ax[i].set_xlim(0,80)

    for n,perc in enumerate(df_plot['skills_percent']):
        ax[i].text(perc + 1, n, f'{perc:.0f}%', va='center')

    if i!=len(Top_3_titles)-1:  # 3-1=2....for the third position(row) chart
     ax[i].set_xticks([])
fig.suptitle("Requirement of Top Skills in US Job Postings",fontsize=20)
fig.tight_layout(h_pad=0.05)  #to fix the overlap
plt.show()
```


### Insights:

- SQL is the most requested skill for Data Analysts and Data Scientists, with it in over half the job postings for both roles. For Data Engineers, Python is the most sought-after skill, appearing in 68% of job postings.
- Data Engineers require more specialized technical skills (AWS, Azure, Spark) compared to Data Analysts and Data Scientists who are expected to be proficient in more general data management and analysis tools (Excel, Tableau).
- Python is a versatile skill, highly demanded across all three roles, but most prominently for Data Scientists (72%) and Data Engineers (65%).

## 2. How are in-demand skills trending for Data Analysts?

To find how skills are trending in 2023 for Data Analysts, I filtered data analyst positions and grouped the skills by the month of the job postings. This got me the top 5 skills of data analysts by month, showing how popular skills were throughout 2023.

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [3_Trending_Skills](3_Trending_Skills.ipynb).


### Visualize Data

```python

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
plt.figure(figsize=(6,6))
df_plot = df_DA_US_percent.iloc[:, :5]
sns.lineplot(data=df_plot, dashes=False, legend='full', palette='tab10')
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
sns.despine() 

plt.title('Trending Top Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
plt.ylabel('Percentage in Total Job Posting')
plt.xlabel('2023')
plt.legend().remove()
plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

# annotate the plot with the top 5 skills using plt.text()
y=[0, 0, 1, -1, 0]
for i in range(5):
    n=df_plot.iloc[-1, i] + y[i]
    plt.text(11.2, n , df_plot.columns[i], color='black')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```

### Insights:
- SQL remains the most consistently demanded skill throughout the year, although it shows a gradual decrease in demand.
- Excel experienced a significant increase in demand starting around September, surpassing both Python and Tableau by the end of the year.
- Both Python and Tableau show relatively stable demand throughout the year with some fluctuations but remain essential skills for data analysts. Sas, while less demanded compared to the others, shows a slight upward trend towards the year's end.

## 3. How well do jobs and skills pay for Data Analysts?

To identify the highest-paying roles and skills, I only got jobs in the United States and looked at their median salary. But first I looked at the salary distributions of common data jobs like Data Scientist, Data Engineer, and Data Analyst, to get an idea of which jobs are paid the most. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [4_Salary_Analysis](4_Salary_Analysis.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data 

```python
sns.boxplot(data=df_US_top6, x='salary_year_avg', y='job_title_short',order=job_order)
sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

plt.title('Salary Distributions in the United States')
plt.xlabel('Yearly Salary (USD)')
plt.ylabel('')
plt.xlim(0, 600000) 
ticks_x = plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K')
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(ticks_x)
plt.show()

```

#### Insights

- There's a significant variation in salary ranges across different job titles. Senior Data Scientist positions tend to have the highest salary potential, with up to $600K, indicating the high value placed on advanced data skills and experience in the industry.

- Senior Data Engineer and Senior Data Scientist roles show a considerable number of outliers on the higher end of the salary spectrum, suggesting that exceptional skills or circumstances can lead to high pay in these roles. In contrast, Data Analyst roles demonstrate more consistency in salary, with fewer outliers.

- The median salaries increase with the seniority and specialization of the roles. Senior roles (Senior Data Scientist, Senior Data Engineer) not only have higher median salaries but also larger differences in typical salaries, reflecting greater variance in compensation as responsibilities increase.

### Highest Paid & Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts

Next, I narrowed my analysis and focused only on data analyst roles. I looked at the highest-paid skills and the most in-demand skills. I used two bar charts to showcase these.


#### Visualize Data

```python

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1,figsize=(12,8))  

sns.set_theme(style='ticks')

# Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_top_pay, x='median', y=df_DA_top_pay.index, hue='median', ax=ax[0], palette='dark:b_r')# b_r= blue_reverse
ax[0].legend().remove()
ax[0].set_title('Top 10 Highest Paid Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[0].set_ylabel('')
ax[0].set_xlabel('')
ax[0].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))


# Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts order by Median salary 
sns.barplot(data=df_DA_skills, x='median', y=df_DA_skills.index, hue='median', ax=ax[1], palette='light:b')
ax[1].legend().remove()
ax[1].set_title('Top 10 Most In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts')
ax[1].set_ylabel('')
ax[1].set_xlabel('Median Salary (USD)')
ax[1].set_xlim(ax[0].get_xlim())  # Set the same x-axis limits as the first plot
ax[1].xaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: f'${int(x/1000)}K'))

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

#### Insights:

- The top graph shows specialized technical skills like `dplyr`, `Bitbucket`, and `Gitlab` are associated with higher salaries, some reaching up to $200K, suggesting that advanced technical proficiency can increase earning potential.

- The bottom graph highlights that foundational skills like `Excel`, `PowerPoint`, and `SQL` are the most in-demand, even though they may not offer the highest salaries. This demonstrates the importance of these core skills for employability in data analysis roles.

- There's a clear distinction between the skills that are highest paid and those that are most in-demand. Data analysts aiming to maximize their career potential should consider developing a diverse skill set that includes both high-paying specialized skills and widely demanded foundational skills.


## 4. What are the most optimal skills to learn for Data Analysts?

To identify the most optimal skills to learn ( the ones that are the highest paid and highest in demand) I calculated the percent of skill demand and the median salary of these skills. To easily identify which are the most optimal skills to learn. 

View my notebook with detailed steps here: [5_Optimal_Skills](5_Optimal_Skills.ipynb).

#### Visualize Data

```python
from adjustText import adjust_text

df_DA_skills_high_demand.plot(kind='scatter', x='skill_percent', y='median_salary')

# Prepare texts for adjustText
texts = []
for i, txt in enumerate(df_DA_skills_high_demand.index):
    texts.append(plt.text(df_DA_skills_high_demand['skill_percent'].iloc[i], df_DA_skills_high_demand['median_salary'].iloc[i], txt))



# Adjust text to avoid overlap
adjust_text(texts, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', color='grey'))

from matplotlib.ticker import PercentFormatter
plt.gca().yaxis.set_major_formatter(plt.FuncFormatter(lambda y, pos: f'${int(y/1000)}K'))
plt.gca().xaxis.set_major_formatter(PercentFormatter(decimals=0))

plt.xlabel('Percent of Skills in Data Analyst Jobs')
plt.ylabel('Median Yearly Salary')
plt.title('Most Optimal Skills for Data Analysts in the US')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

```


#### Insights:

- The skill `Oracle` appears to have the highest median salary of nearly $97K, despite being less common in job postings. This suggests a high value placed on specialized database skills within the data analyst profession.

- More commonly required skills like `Excel` and `SQL` have a large presence in job listings but lower median salaries compared to specialized skills like `Python` and `Tableau`, which not only have higher salaries but are also moderately prevalent in job listings.

- Skills such as `Python`, `Tableau`, and `SQL Server` are towards the higher end of the salary spectrum while also being fairly common in job listings, indicating that proficiency in these tools can lead to good opportunities in data analytics.
